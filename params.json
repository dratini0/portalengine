{"name":"Portalengine","tagline":"Portal-based rendering engine demo","body":"# Portal-based rendering engine demo\r\n\r\nThis is a WebGL/three.js implementation for a portal-enabled rendering engine.\r\n\r\n## What are portals?\r\n\r\nPortals are polygons seamlessly connecting two parts of space.\r\nThey have a polygon and a transformation matrix associated to them.\r\nThe polygon is the shape of the portal, a convex and coplanar set of\r\npoints. The transformation matrix defines the transformation which\r\nany object passing through the portal is subjected to. It can be any\r\nkind of a matrix: even a non-uniform scale!\r\n\r\nThese portals are similar to Unreal Engine's WarpZones, or\r\nSource's Areaportals but are much more capable then those, as they\r\nallow any arbitrary affine transform.\r\n\r\nThey are stationary and transition through them will be seamless,\r\nallowing fo various forms of impossible spaces.\r\n\r\n## Insipration\r\n\r\nThis thing was mainly inspired by a [video on YouTube by user\r\ntonymyre311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xFbRecjKQA).\r\n\r\n## Running things locally\r\n\r\nIf you want to run this program locally you will have to use some\r\ntricks.
